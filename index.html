      <h1 class="head">Make Dad Jokes Great Again (MDJGA)</h1>

      <p class="text">
        Dad jokes have been on a rapid decline over the past 10 years. Here at
        MDJGA we aim to revive them. Our plan is to reeducate today's dads on
        how to properly inflict second hand embarrassment on their children. To
        do that, we will employ dads from all over the country to act as
        professors with the goal of keeping their legacy alive. They will be
        provided with the classrooms and equipment necessary for them to fulfil
        their roles to the best of their ability. We recognize that this is a
        rather ambitious goal and, should it work we project that by 2028, all
        dads new and old will be an unstoppable geyser of glorious dad jokes.
